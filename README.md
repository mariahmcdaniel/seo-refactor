In this project, I have taken steps to refactor the code of a given web page in order to improve the SEO and make it more accessible. This includes:

- Replacing div and span tags with appropriate semantic elements
- Adding metadata to the HTML head
- Utilizing alt tags on images 
- Editing CSS selectors and consolidating styles
